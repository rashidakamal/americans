# The Times They Are A Changin’ (Maybe)

The rise of populism and the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of United States are indicators that American life is not what it once was. Though pundits have pointed to large socioeconomic factors that have led us to the present political moment, it is worth examining how everyday American life has changed in the past decade and how those smaller changes may have contributed to the rightward shift in the political attitudes of some Americans. 

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS), sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, attempts to capture how Americans spend their time, down to the minute. The ATUS is conducted on a monthly basis, involving a sample size of approximate 2,000 to 3,000 households – a subset of the households who have finished their final month in the Current Population Survey (another large-scale survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau). 

The data collected through this survey is vast and granular – demographic details of each respondent is captured, along with a time diary of how they have spent their previous day. 

The publicly available ATUS data spans from 2003 to 2015, allowing us to extrapolate snapshots of American life at several critical junctures.

Some things have been rather stable over the years. Even through difficult economic times, Americans have, on average, worked about 8 hours a day. What has changed, however, is that from 2005 to 2015, Americans are spending an additional 24 minutes on other income-generating activities. 

Of those Americans who are searching for work, the 2015 job hunter spends on average 43 more minutes a day searching than their 2005 counterpart. 

Interestingly, the Americans have also seen an a very modest increase in leisure – in 2015, they spent six more minutes a day on activities such socializing, relaxing, watching TV and exercising than in 2005. 

This reality is further complicated by the fact that Americans are spending less time engaged in community-related activities (of either religious or civic nature). Though Americans are working harder and playing harder – they seem to be engaging less with each other in an organized manner – a notion put forth as early as 1995 by political scientist Robert D. Putnam. 

Last decade and a half have brought a mixed bag of changes for most Americans – though most of the changes in the everyday life of Americans are not necessarily dramatic, increases in time spent on activities such as job searching perhaps indicate that even if realities are not dramatically different, certainly perceptions are. 

While the overall averages of the ATUS survey data provide interesting glimpses into what has changed, it would also be worth investigating if some changes have affected different demographic groups or even geographic areas disproportionately. Given the tone that American populism has taken – with a rise of white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups – it would also be worth investigating how ATUS varies by race or income level.

It is quite possible that national averages, like the ones presented in the available ATUS data tables, need to be even more granular in their analysis to be meaningful in exposing how everyday American life has changed – and importantly, who might be upset by those changes.
